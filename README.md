# Reviewed and documented security incidents using the incident handler`s journal

## Scenario #1

As a cybersecurity analyst, I have to review the details of a security incident and document the incident using the incident handler`s journal.

A small U.S. health care clinic specializing in primary-care services experienced a security incident on a Tuesday morning, at approximately 9:00 am. Several employees reported that they could not use their computers to access files like medical records. Business operations shut down because employees were unable to access the files and software needed to do their jobs.

Employees also reported that a ransom note was displayed on their computers. The ransom note stated that all the company`s files were encrypted by an organized group of unethical hackers known to target healthcare and transportation organizations. In exchange for restoring access to the encrypted files, the ransom note demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key.

The attackers were able to gain access to the companys network by using targeted phishing emails, which were sent to several employees of the company. The phishing emails contained a malicious attachment that installed malware on the employee`s computer once it was downloaded.

Once the attackers gained access, they deployed their ransomware, which encrypted critical files. The company was unable to access critical patient data, causing major disruptions in its business operations. The company was forced to shut down its computer systems and contact several organizations to report the incident and receive technical assistance
